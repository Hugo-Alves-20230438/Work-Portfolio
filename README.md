Hi! I'm Hugo, a 21-year old graduated in **Management**. Being passionate about learning and critically analyzing new information, I am currently attending the first year of the Master's in **Data Science and Advanced Analytics**, with a specialization in **Business Analytics**. <br>
In this repository, you can take a look at some of the projects that I (individually or as part of a group) have been developing throughout the past months. Below, you will find a short summary of each one.

#### Hospital Readmission Prediction
Hospital readmissions represent a significant challenge in the healthcare sector, both as an indicator of care quality and a driver of escalating costs. Therefore, being able to predict such readmissions can lead to
improved patient care and substantial cost savings. <br>
Given these circumstances, we approached the readmissions problem from two perspectives: a **binary classification** model to predict if a patient would be readmitted 30 days post-discharge and a **multiclass classification model**, broadening the options to predict readmissions after 30 days. Using a diabetes dataset, we tested several models for both cases after a rigorous data cleaning and feature selection comprising eight filter, wrapper, and embedded methods, including ANOVA, decision tree, and LASSO. In both cases, we have single models, including logistic regression, support vector machines and neural networks, and ensemble models, such as random forests and stacking.
